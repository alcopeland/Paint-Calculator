Paint Calculator for borwell

To run my program you must access the folder from the terminal and run:

javac *.java   -   to compile the program

java Driver    -   to run the program

If I had more time I would have added:
-A way to use multiple rooms
-A way to use non-rectangular rooms
-A way to select unique units for each length
